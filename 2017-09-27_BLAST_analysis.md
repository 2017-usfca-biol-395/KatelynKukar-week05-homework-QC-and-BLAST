### Project Owner: Katelyn Kukar; kbkukar@usfca.edu

## Project Overview:
#### Create a script which downloads multiple amplicon sequences in fastq format. Trim and align the sequeneces within each file utilizing a code loop to record the basic output. Run the output against the NCBI database via Blast to provide evidence for or against the Fierer Paper that established this experiment.
#### The Fierer paper discusses the diversity of skin-associated bacterial communities and their ability to colonize objects tounched by their host (electronic devices).

## Primary Question:
#### Does the sequencing data match bacterial colonies found on humans or from regions that participants  within the study could have received them from?

## Analysis
### Analysis of species variants:
#### Quantification of the number of different species visualized through blast is listed within the file "unique_outputs.txt." This file lists the number of times a certain species was sequences for throughout all the data files.
#### The top 5 most common species were:
##### 1. *Solemya pervernicosa gill symbiont* (2372 times sequenced)
##### 2. *Bartonella washoensis* (1583 times sequenced)
##### 3. *Bacteroidetes endosymbiont of Metaseiulus occidentalis* (1164 times sequenced)
##### 4. *Aquitalea sp. KJ011* (571 times sequenced)
##### 5. *Pinus oocarpa* (392 times sequenced)

#### *Solemya pervernicosa gill symbiont* is a bacteria that resides in the taxa of sulfur-oxidizing symbionts. This means this bacteria usually requires a host environment where in which its cohabitation benefits the host. The sulfur-oxidizing symbionts tend to inhabit marine hosts, much as the classification *Soleyma pervernicosa* defines. *Soleyma pervernicosa* is a small bivalve, salt-water clam that resides in shallow marine habitats. Concluding that the sulfur-oxidizing feature of this symbiont is to give nutrition to the bivalve since it naturally lacks a digestive system.

#### *Bartonella washoensis*: Bacterium that can cause meningitis in humans, but is more readily present in squirrels and dogs.
#### *Bacteroidetes endosymbiont of Metaseiulus occidentalis*: Bacteriodetes are armored scaled insects with endosymbiont populations and in this example represents a mite. Mites are related to ticks and utilize host environments to gather nutrients.
#### *Aquitalea sp. KJ011*: The genus Aquitalea is from the proteobacteria with many forms being found in lakes.
#### *Pinus oocarpa*: This is a species of pine tree related to Mexico and Central America


#### By deducing that the most readily sequenced species variant is a bacteria endemic to a marine clam population, not humans or very humanoid regions, we can conclude there may be potential error in our sequencing results. To test the quality of the matches we must visualize them within our blast files. This percent match data per species variant can be seen in percentmatch_outputs.txt in the output folder.

#### 1. *Solemya pervernicosa gill symbiont* receives a percent match score of 80.82-100%, with a mean of 86.16%.
##### Error within blast results can be attributed to our trimming or alignment, however the shear number of sequences received and attributed to this specific organism lends to more statistical anlysis for proof of error against the null hypothesis of a match.
#### 2. *Bartonella washoensis 99.56-100% match
#### 3. *Bacteroidetes endosymbiont of Metaseiulus occidentalis* 97.76-100% match
#### 4. *Aquitalea sp. KJ011* 94.84% match                    
#### 5. *Pinus oocarpa* 96.02-100% match
 
### Discussion of Species Variants and Percent Matches

#### Noah Fierer conducted the study of interest within his lab at Colorado Boulder. By utilizing this extra piece of information about the participants region of inhabitance we can infer that high altitude bacterial species, forest species, lake species, etc. can be considered as relevant. This is unlike urban settings alone.

#### 1. *Solemya pervernicosa gill symbiont*
##### Having a salt water clam endosymbiont within many of the participant tests even though all participants reside in Boulder, Colorado lends itself to inferences based on participants interacting with the bivalve in large scale, simultaneously. Potentially, a large clam bake took place prior to the study with many participants going for the free clams (assuming many were poor Boulder students not being sufficiently fed at Tailgates). Upon, further research there is an annual Boulder Clam-bake however if this particular type of clam was served, and if it carried this endosymbiont remains unknown. It also remains unknown if individuals actually participated in the clambake or if this is speculation about their financial status.

#### 2. *Bartonella washoensis
##### This bacterium can be found on squirrels, dogs, and in meningitis infected humans. Assuming again all participants were Boulder students it can be deduced that potentially meningitis was spread in the dorms. The outdoors nature of the campus also lends itself to the potential for interaction with wildlife that may carry this form of bacterium and concluding its inhabitance on campus grounds.
##### This bacterium also has a higher average percent match rate meaning that the exact strand was more commonly sequenced among participants yielding more evidence toward a common interaction due to a localized species.

#### 3.  *Bacteroidetes endosymbiont of Metaseiulus occidentalis*
##### Mites endosymbionts could again be attributed to college living where a lack of cleanliness and sufficient exposure to the outdoors and feral/wild animals is more common. Weekend hiking trips can cause interaction with common deer grazing regions, where in which mites can be found. Squirrels carrying the bacterium analyzed as #2 may also be carriers for mites.

#### 4. *Aquitalea sp. KJ011*
##### Lake bound proteobacteria can again be attributed to the rustic location of Boulder Colorado. Many students spend weekends at Varsity Lake nearby.

#### 5. *Pinus oocarpa*
##### This pine tree has a close relative native to Colorado and found in Boulder.

#### Overall, we can see that a majority of the high percentage matches are attributed to the region of the sample population. However, more analysis needs to be done on the most commonly sequenced endosymbiont which is endemic to clams. These clams seem to have only extraneous connections to the study itself, therefore more relevant information is needed.
