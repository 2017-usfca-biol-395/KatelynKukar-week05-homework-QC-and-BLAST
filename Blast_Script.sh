# This is a project setup for BionInformatics Homework Week 5
# This project's main goal is to Blast multiple sequences that have been trimmed to establish, which organisms are present in the data and to analyze the importance of visualizing these specific organisms in relation to the study
# The study of interest is by Fierer et al relating bacterial communities on the skin to bacteria recovered from surfaces of contact
